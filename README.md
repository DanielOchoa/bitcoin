What is Dancoin?
----------------

Dancoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Dancoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Dancoin Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

This is a hard fork of bitcoin, and it's the next big thing! If you want to be an early adopter and probably make billions, hit me up at dannytenaglias@gmail.com.
